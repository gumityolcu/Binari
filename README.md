This is a repository for Senior Project in Boğaziçi University Computer Engineering Department.

The work has just barely started. I intend to put the research done, papers read and the codes written in the repository.

The project's aim is to write a computer program that generates poems called "Gazel"s in Ottoman Turkish.
